# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C, demonstrating various fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
These are the programs that I have written within my Data Structures course in the college.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

### Data Structures
- **Arrays**:
    - Basic array operations
    - Array-based stack implementation
    - Postfix expression evaluation
    - Parenthesis balancing
    - Tower of Hanoi solution

- **Linked Lists**:
    - Singly linked list
    - Doubly linked list
    - Circular linked list
    - Cycle detection in linked list
    - Linked list reversal
    - Polynomial addition

- **Queue**:
    - Standard queue implementation
    - Circular queue
    - Deque (double-ended queue)
    - Priority queue
    - Queue using linked list

- **Stack**:
    - String implementation
    - Basic stack operations

### Sorting Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort (recursive and iterative)
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Radix Sort

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (recursive and iterative)
- Index Sequential Search

## Prerequisites

- C Compiler (GCC recommended)
- CMake (version 3.30 or higher)

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ds-codes.git
   cd ds-codes
   ```

2. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Generate build files:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Running Executables

After building, you can run the executables from the build directory. The main executable is `ds_codes`, and there's also a `new_target` executable.
